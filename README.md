# Visualize

Server-side SVG visualization library for Elixir Phoenix LiveView, inspired by D3.

This is built for my own experimentation and use.  This generates SVG, so it is not going to be a good candidate for for than about 1000 data points.

see: [Liveview Plotting Strategies](dev_docs/liveview_plotting_strategies.md)

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `visualize` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:visualize, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/visualize>.
